Sri Lanka have rescheduled their Test series in New Zealand for April after cutting short the original tour because of the Asian tsunami disaster.

The series will also be backed by the Federation of International Cricketers' Associations, under whose name the World XI will play. "We believe we have a responsibility to do whatever we can to support other members of the cricketing community. "In forming the inaugural FICA World XI, we are able to support ICC member countries and the larger community at what is a very difficult time. "The series will give us an opportunity to raise valuable funds through related charitable activities and ensure New Zealand has international cricket at the height of its summer," said FICA chief executive Tim May. The venues for Sri Lanka's Tests in New Zealand have yet to be decided. And there is concern that weather could be a factor in the series. But Snedden said:"The climatic conditions in early April are normally similar to those in March and we are confident Test cricket can be played at this time of year. "A decision about the venues for the re-scheduled Tests should be made within the next two weeks. "We are also working with the Sri Lankan Cricket Board to reschedule the unplayed one-day international matches and hope to play a four-match ODI series during next season's Christmas/New Year period."
