Russell to instruct keeper Jones

Former England and Gloucestershire wicket-keeper Jack Russell has been called in to give coaching to current national team gloveman Geraint Jones.

Jones did not have the best of tours in South Africa, dropping catches and conceding too many byes. Now England coach Duncan Fletcher has sought out the 54-Test veteran. Russell told the Daily Express: "Duncan and captain Michael Vaughan have asked me to build a relationship with Geraint and give him whatever help he needs." The pair have already worked closely but Russell will be heavily involved as the countdown to the Ashes begins. He said: "Geraint has got the ability to play 100 Tests for England. He has the right attitude.
